When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with a team with many people contributing to a project or where you might be using multiple computers to work on a project to make sure all the code is committed to the same repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  If you're making changes locally to a Git repository you might want to commit those changes manually to the Git repository rather than having the changes made on GitHub override those changes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  
  A branch occurs within a repository.  A clone copies an existing library to your local machine, but does not maintain a reference to the original repository.  A fork maintains the original reference to that library.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Having the last known state of the remote stored locally allows you to make changes to the file when you do not have internet access and cannot access GitHub.  By having the last known state stored locally you know you're working off the latest version.
